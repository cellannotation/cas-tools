    "### Converting an Allen-Style Taxonomy Spreadsheet to CAS Format  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to convert an Allen-style taxonomy spreadsheet into the CAS (Cell Annotation Schema) format, how to merge it to an h5a file and how to export to CAP anndata formt. The process includes the following steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate CAS**: Convert the spreadsheet data into the CAS format.\n",
    "2. **Validate CAS against h5ad**: Compare CAS and AnnData to check if the annotations and the hierarchy are the same.\n",
    "3. **Populate IDs**: Add corresponding Cell IDs to the CAS from a related Anndata (h5ad) file.  \n",
    "4. **Merge Data**: Integrate the updated CAS into the `var` field of the Anndata object.\n",
    "5. **Export to CAP**: Merge CAS in \n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow uses a subset of the WMBO dataset. Example Allen-style spreadsheet is derived from the `CB Glut (CS20230722_CLAS_29)` subset of the Mouse Cell-type annotations (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06812-z#Sec49, Table 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to carry out these steps in Python, but most can also be done via the [cas-tools command-line interface](https://cellannotation.github.io/cas-tools/cli.html)."
