    "### Converting an Allen-Style Taxonomy Spreadsheet to CAS Format  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to convert an Allen-style taxonomy spreadsheet into the CAS (Cell Annotation Schema) format. The process includes the following steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate CAS**: Convert the spreadsheet data into the CAS format.\n",
    "2. **Validate CAS against h5ad**: Compare CAS and AnnData to check if the annotations and the hierarchy are the same.\n",
    "3. **Populate IDs**: Add corresponding Cell IDs to the CAS from a related Anndata (h5ad) file.  \n",
    "4. **Merge Data**: Integrate the updated CAS into the `var` field of the Anndata object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow uses a subset of the WMBO dataset. Example Allen-style spreadsheet is derived from the `CB Glut (CS20230722_CLAS_29)` subset of the Mouse Cell-type annotations (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06812-z#Sec49, Table 7) "
